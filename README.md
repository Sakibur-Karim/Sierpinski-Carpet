# Sierpinski-Carpet

This is a Java program which simulates a Sierpinski Carpet. I did this for one of my college project.

## What is a Sierpinki Carpet?

The technique of subdividing a shape into smaller copies of itself, removing one or more copies, and continuing recursively can be extended to other shapes. For instance, subdividing an equilateral triangle into four equilateral triangles, removing the middle triangle, and recursing leads to the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle. In three dimensions, a similar construction based on cubes is known as the Menger sponge.
